# LiveKit Data Track

**Important**:
This is an internal crate that powers the data tracks feature in LiveKit client SDKs (including [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/livekit) and others) and is not usable directly.

To use data tracks in your application, please use the public APIs provided by the client SDKs.
