# LiveKit FFI

Foreign function interface (FFI) bindings for LiveKit, used to support the following client SDKs:

- [Python](https://github.com/livekit/python-sdks)
- [NodeJS](https://github.com/livekit/node-sdks)
- [Unity](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity)

This crate is compiled as dynamic library, allowing client languages to invoke APIs from the core [_livekit_](https://crates.io/crates/livekit) crate.
