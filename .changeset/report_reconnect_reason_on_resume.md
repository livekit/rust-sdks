Report the reconnect reason to the server when resuming.

Resumes previously sent no reason, so server-side telemetry could not attribute why Rust
clients reconnect — every resume looked like `RR_UNKNOWN`. The engine now records what caused
the episode (signal disconnected, publisher failed, subscriber failed) and reports it on each
resume attempt. The v0 signalling path was also missing the `reconnect_reason` query parameter
entirely, so it would not have been reported even if a reason had been supplied.
